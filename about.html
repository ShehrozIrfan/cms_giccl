            <div class="para_1">
              Our college is one of the first ranked institutions of the Punjab. Let us have a glance on the past history of the college. The history of the Govt. Islamia College Civil Lines, Lahore goes back to the last years of the 19th century when the Arya Samajists founded the school of Dayanand Ayur Vedic on June 1, 1886. The huge building of Dayanand Vedic College (DAV College) experienced many revolutionary changes in the last two centuries. The school started Intermediate classes in 1888 and graduate classes in 1892 and finally M.A. in 1895. The name of the college was attributed to the Hindu leader Sawami Dayanand Sarasvati, founder of the Arya Samaj moment.

              In 1947, the Muslim Muhajreen from the East Punjab were accommodated in the building of this college. Later this building was divided into two institutions including Taleem-ul-Islam (which was shifted to Rabwa in 1954) and LSNF School (Licentiate State Medical Faculty). In 1955, the college building was acquired by the Anjuman-e-Himayat-i-Islam. The Anjuman gave a new name of Islamia College to this previously DAV College. Initially the administration of both Islamia College Railway Road and Islamia College Civil Lines remained with The Anjuman-e-Himayat-i-Islam. 1958, Anjuman decided to give separate identity to Islamia College Civil Lines Lahore.
